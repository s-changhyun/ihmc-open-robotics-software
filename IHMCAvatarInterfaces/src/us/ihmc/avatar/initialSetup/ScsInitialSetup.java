 * SCS Initial Setup
 * Implementations of this interface are designed to configure settings in SCS (the simulation environment).  
 * This includes physical things like gravity and terrain, as well as logical things like the simulation time step and the recording frequency for YoVariables.
 * 
 * Notice: To date, gravity and terrain are aspects of Robot, so the Robot object passed will be modified.
